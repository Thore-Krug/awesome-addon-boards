The Zero already has FastEthernet, but also has two unused USB lanes.

Could we use them to provide two more FastEthernet plugs?

Or even better, could we add up to 5 ports (without the plugs, just JST for example) so that it would have 5 Ethernet connexions?

Could we use anything else on the Zero to get better than FastEthernet?

USB2.0 could go up to 330Mb/s, right?

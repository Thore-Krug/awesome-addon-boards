The idea of this hat is to create an end node of LoRaWAN, so that the Zero will be able to get in touch with a LoRaWAN gateway. Could we add anything directly on the board, like an ADC, so that we can grab data from sensors, and forward them to our application server thanks to LoRaWAN?

Depending on the IC we'll find, it would be nice to have also the gateway mode.

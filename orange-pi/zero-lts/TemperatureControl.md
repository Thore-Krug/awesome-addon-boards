I use the Zero as a way to control the temperature in my 19" server racks.
For the time being, it is done with off-the-shelf parts, but I'm sure we can do better with the hat.

What I'm looking for is :
 - being fed by 12V
 - grab the temperature at several places in the rack
 - control several 12V or 5V fans (PWM or not)
 - display on an OLED what's going on
 - UPS so that we don't destroy the SDCard when shutting down the server
 - use some DIN41612 so that we can get and send the data thanks to a backplane
